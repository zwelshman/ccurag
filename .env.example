# Cloud Storage for Persistence (for Streamlit Cloud deployment)
# Google Drive - Two Options:
#
# Option 1: OAuth2 (FREE - for personal Google Drive 15GB)
#   1. Run: python setup_gdrive_oauth.py
#   2. Creates .gdrive_token.pickle (automatically used by the app)
#   3. No need to set GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
#
# Option 2: Service Account (for Google Workspace Shared Drive - requires paid account)
#   1. Get service account JSON from Google Cloud Console
#   2. Create a Shared Drive in Google Workspace
#   3. Share the drive with the service account email
#   4. Set GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_JSON below (must be on ONE SINGLE LINE)
#   5. Use convert_gdrive_creds.py to convert multi-line JSON to single line
#
# IMPORTANT: Service accounts CANNOT write to personal Google Drive
# They require a Google Workspace Shared Drive ($6+/month)
#
# Example (single line):
# GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"...@....iam.gserviceaccount.com",...}
